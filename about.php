            <h3>EDUCATION POLICY 2023-2027</h3>
            <p>The Education has embarked on the implementation of the Education Policy 2023-27. This is a meticulously devised, strategic roadmap, directing the efforts over a five year period to transform education; directly confronting and addressing the critical challenges facing Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s education landscape.
                It not only reflects our National Developmental goals, but also underscores our dedication to the achievement of international mandates, notably the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
            </p>  
            <p>Since 2020, an extensive three-phase consultation process involved education stakeholders in virtual and written discussions, with a keen focus on the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education.
                The Policy which has emerged from these consultations recognises the need to equip our citizens with the skills to surmount the challenges of the 21st century. It stands on the shoulders of the recommendations, initiatives, and achievements of its predecessor, bolstered by ongoing research, in-depth analysis, and continued engagement with all stakeholders who grapple with the intricate and unique challenges within Trinidad and Tobago’s educational landscape.
            </p>
            <p>The Education Policy 2023-2027 underscores the paramount significance of our young citizens, and the importance of their educational achievements, as well as their values, attitudes and behaviours in shaping the future of Trinidad and Tobago. 
                It recognizes the need for systemic, curricular and operational transformation in achieving the vision of the Education- modern, relevant, equitable education for all.
            </p>

            <p>The Education has responsibility for the management of all public Early Childhood Care Education (ECCE), Primary, Secondary and Tertiary education institutions and oversight of all private education institutions in Trinidad and Tobago (in conjunction with the Tobago House of Assembly’s Education, Research and Technology Division)
                Conveniently located on lower St. Vincent Street, downtown Port of Spain, the government is a one-stop hub for all education-related matters. The head office is comprised of two structures: Tower A, which has sixteen floors that houses its administrative operations and Tower B, a five-storey building that houses the Finance and Accounts Division.
                 With most of its customer-accessed services located in Tower A, including a dedicated customer service area, stakeholders have ready access to all of their information needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To collect information about teachers in Sri Lanka an application has been applied by the Education department on the website of the Education so every teacher is requested to apply the application.
